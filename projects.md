## Personal Projects

1. **Smile Detection**  
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning***    
   **Description:**   
   Implemented simple CNN network to detect smile. Trained the classifier in colab using data found in <a href="https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD" target="_blank">github</a>. Then created a simple program to classify and mark smiles in videos using *haar cascade classifier* and the trained model. The model achieved 93% test accuracy.  
   It was done as a part of learning **PyTorch** framework and the whole network is implemented in **PyTorch**.

2. **Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition**    
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning***    
   **Description:**    
   Implemented a Bangla Handwritten Digit recognizer using **PyTorch**. It achieved 89% accuracy on about 1000 test images collected using *Image Data Collection system*. We trained the model on data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/BengaliAI/numta" target="_blank">NumtaDB</a> . It was done as a part of testing Image Data Collection system and to facilitate learning of **PyTorch** framework.

3. **Image Data Collector System**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   Implemented a system for collecting and providing simple annotation for Image Data. It has an *Android* front end built using **IONIC** framework, while the back end uses **Flask**. It was tested in real server and we collected about 1000 hand written digit images. This system can also be modified to provide an online classification service by hosting a trained classifier in the server side.  
   I wanted to try out a **Cross Platform** framework and learn **Flask** as it's known to be very minimalistic. So, I built the system while teaching myself about these technologies. I am currently working with an extension of this idea which can be found <a target="_blank" href="/research">here</a>.

4. **Convolutor**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   A research tool that can calculate the output sizes of *2D Convolution, 2D Transposed Convolution, Max Pool 2D and Max Unpool 2D* given the required parameters. It is built using **Tkinter** framwork.  
   While learning **PyTorch**, I felt irritated as I had to calculate the outputs of different CNN and MaxPool layers again and again. So to ease the learning process as well as to learn a python GUI library, I implemented this simple calculator-like program in **Tkinter**.

5. **FileShare**  
   ***Type: Software***  
   **Description:**  
   A two part system for file sharing between *Windows, Android and Linux* systems using a common Wifi network. PC's software is done using **JavaFX** while mobile's software is done using **Android SDK**. It was done to acquire a firm grasp on the concepts of **Multi-Threading and Socket Programming**.

6. **BrackFire**  
   ***Type: Software***  
   **Decription:**  
   A fire watch system that can be used to call nearby fire station, alert nearby devices (wit the app) and track the fire service car as it responds to a call.  
   Implemented the back end database using **Firebase API**, the **Tracking System** by using **Google Maps and Firebase API** simultaneously, and the **Push Notification System** using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** API.  
   It was built as part of a freelance software development, and to get myself introduced to the aforementioned technologies.


7. **BasicProgressTracker**  
   ***Type: Software***  
   **Description:**  
   A simple android application for managing personal time between different tasks. It was developed as a part of **teaching android development** to some of my students.
