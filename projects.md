## Personal Projects

1. **Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition**    
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning***    
   **Description:**    
   Implemented a Bangla Handwritten Digit recognizer using **PyTorch**. It achieved 89% accuracy on test images collected using *Image Data Collection system*. We collected about 1000 test images. It was done as a part of testing Image Data Collection system and to facilitate learning of **PyTorch** framework.

2. **Image Data Collector System**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   Implemented a system for collecting and providing simple annotation for Image Data. It has an *Android* front end built using **IONIC** framework, while the back end uses **Flask**. It was tested in real server and we collected about 1000 hand written digit images.  
   I wanted to try out a **Cross Platform** framework and learn **Flask** as it's known to be very minimalistic. So, I built the system while teaching myself about these technologies. I am currently working with an extension of this idea which can be found <a target="_blank" href="/research">here</a>.

3. **Convolutor**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   A research tool that can calculate the output sizes of *2D Convolution, 2D Transposed Convolution, Max Pool 2D and Max Unpool 2D* given the required parameters. It was built using **Tkinter** framwork.  
   While learning **PyTorch**, I felt irritated as I had to calculate the outputs of different CNN and MaxPool layers again and again. So to ease the learning process as well as to learn a python GUI library, I implemented this simple calculator-like program in **Tkinter**.
