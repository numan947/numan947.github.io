## Research Projects

1. **A Configurable Platform for Accumulation and Annotation of Data (on going)**  
   ***Description:***  
   Deep learning and machine learning techniques has recently gained a lot of attention and are becoming more ubiquitous day by day. One of the major drawbacks often faced in machine learning projects is the lack of enough data. Even when enough data is available, it is often found that the data is not annotated according to the requirements of the task. As a result, an ample amount of time and often money is needed to augment the data according to the need, and it is hard to collaboratively take part in data collection, augmentation and annotation because of lack of a structured system.  
   We are trying to address this problem by creating a mobile platform for collecting and annotating data. The platform can be configured to cater to individual projects. We are providing a simplified backend server that can be used to give structure to the collection of new data, and distribution and annotation of the data needed to be augmented or modified according to the task's requirements.

2. **Data Mining for Revealing Influential Socioeconomic Factors of Disease Outbreaks**  
   ***Description:***  
   Disease outbreaks occur all over the world almost every year. In this project, we tried to related the natures of disease outbreaks with different socioeconomic factors of different parts of the world. Specifically, we first accumulated data on disease outbreaks's occurrences (what, when and where), associated socioeconomic factors of that place and time, and the disease's natures. Then we used correlation techniques (Pearson and Spearman) to determine the potential influence of socioeconomic factors on the outbreaks of the diseases with the corresponding natures. We preprocessed and derived correlations of 193 socioeconomic attributes with 185 different characteristics of diseases (and their outbreaks).  
   This project can help choose better features for future Machine Learning models for disease outbreak detection and prediction. Additionally, it may direct further research to investigate the reasons behind the overt correlations between the variables.
