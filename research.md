## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the following areas including their interdisciplinary applications: 
  + Machine Learning, specifically Deep Learning
  + Software Engineering
  + Network Security

## Research Projects

1. **Data Mining for Revealing Influential Socioeconomic Factors of Disease Outbreaks**  
   ***Description:***  
   Disease outbreaks occur all over the world almost every year. In this project, we tried to related the natures of disease outbreaks with different socioeconomic factors of different parts of the world. Specifically, we first accumulated data on disease outbreaks's occurrences (what, when and where), associated socioeconomic factors of that place and time, and the disease's natures. Then we used correlation techniques (Pearson and Spearman) to determine the potential influence of socioeconomic factors on the outbreaks of the diseases with the corresponding natures. We preprocessed and derived correlations of 193 socioeconomic attributes with 185 different characteristics of diseases (and their outbreaks).  
   This project can help choose better features for future Machine Learning models for disease outbreak detection and prediction. Additionally, it may direct further research to investigate the reasons behind the overt correlations between the variables.
